                            rbm_settings.cf HELP document

  INSTALLATION
    - Download and unzip the contents to a server / directory of your choice.
    - Open rbm_settings.cf and change the first few options for your server setup.
    - Copy the contents of /rbm_icons/* to your TS3 virtual server.
      '.../teamspeak/files/virtualserver_1/internal/icons' for example.
      Please go through the settings.cf features and select the corresponding icon pack or
      leave the entire icon pack off your virtual server if disabling a particular feature.
    - Make sure rbmod.pl is set to 744+ (executable) and run #: ./rbmod.pl


  OTHER NOTES
    - Remember to add RbMod's IP to the TS3 query_ip_whitelist.txt
    - Disable logging of server permissions on your virtual server might reduce any excess
      HDD activity.


__ TeamSpeak3 Server Credentials _______________________________________________
Enter all the information to log into your TS3 server here, including the global
list of protected groups, which RbMod uses through-out some other features.

- Query_Address
About: Choose either a DNS or IP Address of your TS3 server.
Values: <Domain Name> or <IP Address>
Example: 192.168.0.2

- Query_Virtual_Server_Port
About: This variable selects the TS3 virtual server to work with after
connecting to your TS3 server's Query_Port.
Values: <Numeric Virtual TS3 UDP Port>
Example: 9987

- Query_Port
About: Choose the TS3 servers query port to connect into with RbMod.
Values: <Numeric TCP Port Number>
Example: 10011

- Query_Login
About: Choose the Log-in credentials of your TS3 query server.
Values: <Log-in Name>
Example: serveradmin

- Query_Password
About: Choose the Password for your TS3 query server.
Values: <Log-in Password>
Example: S4zOSR8i

- Query_Bot_Name & Query_Bot_Name2
About: Choose a name for the Mod while connected to your TS3 server. This name
will be seen when the Mod interacts with the server or clients.
Values: <45 character Query Nickname>
Example: RbMod Rocks

- Query_Connect_Retry
About: When RbMod drops a connection to your TS3 server, this value defines the
amount of attempts to reconnect, before giving up.
Values: <Numeric Count Number>
Example: 5

- Query_Connect_Retry_Delay
About: Define in <seconds> the amount of time RbMod pauses between Query_Retry
attempts.
Values: <Seconds>
Example: 5

- Query_Limit
About: This variable defines the number of clients RbMod will read every loop,
every second. Parsing the clientlist into chunks of your choosing. If the
number of clients on your server exceeds this query limit, RbMod will take an
extra second to read the extra chunk you've defined here, thus taking two
passes to completely read through every client on the server, effectively
decreasing bytes transferred to and from your TS3 server and RbMod, while
slowing a few features such as the traffic meter and channel flood detection.
As these features might skip a beat, depending on the number of Mod queries it
takes to complete the entire clientlist process.
Values: <Limit>
Example: 15

- Guest_Group_ID
About: Upon booting up, Rb will duplicate your default Guest Group and place
new clients into this replicated group. This is necessary as RbMod uses
it's own groups for features, and in doing so each client must part the
temporary default guest group. This setting will ensure the client remains in a
'guest' group duplicate after Rb feature placements(s). Use Default to scan for
the word 'Guest', and RbMod will use this group as the default guest group.
Values: <GroupID> or <Default>
Example: Default

- Guest_Group_Name
About: Choose a name for this replicated guest group.
Example: Abnormal

- Guest_Group_Sort_Order 
About: Select the Sort order for rbmods replicated guest group. This will also
position the icon next to a clients name.
Values: <number>
Example: 999

- Guest_Group_Exempt_Group_IDs
About: Here you can decide on which groups RbMod considers 'regular' groups,
basically every group outside the guest group. As RbMod will assign the
replicated Guest group it created upon boot-up to anyone outside this list.
Some other features draw upon these values for exemptions.
Values: <GroupID>,<GroupID>,<GroupID>,<etc.>
Example: 2,9,10

- All_Language_Filters_Exempt_Group_IDs
