- Increased cache read from once a second to 2-3 a second.
+ Added Subscribe_To_Rb_Online_Server_List_* feature.


=== Release 3.2.3 ( Aug 12 2013 ) ===

+ Added the possibility to add multiple RBL servers to 'RBL_Server' setting,

* Changed The weather / geo features to use separate .pl files under rbm_tools/
  This new version will only use fork() calls for the main mod instance(s),
  no longer will individual fork replication occur for new client connections,
  in turn reducing overall memory consumption for RbMod.
- Fixed RBL watching for IP changes & rescanning when change detected.


=== Release 3.2.2 ( June 29 2013 ) ===

- Fixed Rank System causing a hang / delay in the mod if a certain rank was

=== Release 3.2.1 ( June 26 2013 ) ===

* Separated 95% of the fork() features into individual Perl files
  (./rbm_tools/*). This means less memory & CPU consumption all around, plus
  Windows servers shouldn't run into the fork() interpreter limitation(s).
    ./rbm_tools/rbm_dns.pl

+ Adjusted the onjoin weather results / user distance to display back to back
  (less verbose).
+ Adjusted the weather / temperatures to calculate ones IP subnet if undefined.
+ Adjusted the group removal speed, increased by 100%.
- Fixed Onjoin Taglines/descriptions not displaying properly since Beta 1b.
- Fixed other minor bugs.


=== Release Ƹ.1 (Beta 1) ( February 05 2013 ) ===

+ Added Mod FEATURE - Auto Update
  Poll for mod updates, & subsequently download any new updated archives
  via booting up RbMod and comparing your version to the online release version.
  Downloaded archives are stored at the root of RbMod.
  ! This feature may eventually auto-update the contents of preexisting files.

+ FEATURE - Ping Meter
  Independent of the TeamSpeak query interface, this new feature will attempt
  to either use the built in module 'Net::Ping' to ping a client IP directly,
  if an ECHO or TCP ping fails, it will fall back to a trace-route to obtain
  either the clients ping directly, or from the first hop or two in front of
  the specific client.

+ FEATURE - Sticky Channel for administrators to drag & drop client
  punishments. Place anyone that's been spamming your server directly into
  a selected channel ID of your choice - The server group 'Rb Sticky' will
  automatically attach to the offending client - until dragged back out of
  the specific channel you've chosen.

+ FEATURE - Client description language filter.
  Monitor all client descriptions for swear words from the rbm_badwords.cf

+ FEATURE - On-join client description / tagline global message.
  Append either a 200 character !tag <here> to display globally to all your
  buddies upon joining the server. !deltag to remove Rb custom saved tagline.
  If the client doesn't choose a !tag, the description field from TS3 will be
  used instead (max of 80 characters). Admins can set client on-join tags
  easily with the later.

+ FEATURE - On-part random color coded goodbye messages.
  RbMod now uses another *.cf file (/rbm_extras/rbm_goodbye.cf) to globally
  text message a random color coated departure message for every 3rd-4th
  disconnection a client makes (independent of other disconnects). This
  feature uses over 1100 HEX color codes to generate 'rainbow' type
  message effects.

+ FEATURE - Geographical Database
  Dependent upon 'Geo::IP::PurePerl' CPan module & rbm_settings.cf On/Off
  toggle, RbMod can now pickup a clients City/Region (database permitting)
  and further utilize these results in other features such as the on-join
  channel creation feature or weather statistics to name a few. This
  feature is disabled by default until both the Geo::IP::PurePerl is installed
  ('cpan' .. 'install Geo::IP::PurePerl') and the free 'GeoLite City' BINARY
  database that this module utilizes is correctly placed at the root of RbMod.
  '/GeoLiteCity.dat'
  'http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz'

+ FEATURE - Weather Conditions
  With 'Geo::IP::PurePerl' correctly running and enabled
  under rbm_settings.cf, our second dependency in which to obtain user
  temperatures comes in the form of 'Weather::Underground'. This module,
  when installed (cpan> 'install Weather::Underground') will enable
  certain temperature statistics to appear next to a clients on-join
  'status' group for a short period, as well as a global Celsius
  / Fahrenheit / Conditions global message upon first connections.
  There's of course the more permanent feature 'Temperatures_On'
  that utilizes 85 temperature icons (from -33c - +50c), updated
  on a set interval for all online connections.

+ FEATURE - RSS Feeds
  With the use of 'XML::Parser' module, RbMod can now attach to a URL of
  your choosing and monitor the contents for changes, globally displaying
  the results with a interval variable.

+ FEATURE - Reconnect Flood Detection Gauge.
  Written in hopes of reducing client re-connections, either intentional
  or from simple repetitive timeouts due to poor client connections, this
  feature will monitor the amount of reconnects under a set period of time,
  each infraction will escalate to further warn, kick & inevitably a ban.
  There's about 6 tiers to this 'grey' list the mod uses to watch ones
  reconnect history.

+ FEATURE - Channel Query 'Bots'.
  Designed intentionally to tap into Screech's 'Now Playing' Music ->
  Channel Plugin. Setup one or more query bots in specific channel(s)
  to watch a target channels text history. Each line from the channel
  chat will immediately go beside a specified client DBID, displaying
  for example the first 30 characters of a song beside a GUI client
  connected in the form of a group 'tag' in brackets, as well as

  changing the targets description to show 0-80 characters of the
  channel text monitored.

+ Added ICONS - 31 new Ping Meter icons. Resembles a color wheel (CD Disc).

+ Added ICONS - 5 new O/S icons.

+ Added ICONS - 85 new Temperature icons.

+ Added ICONS - Third Military pack of 27 ranked icons.

+ Added ICONS - 238 country code icons (Utilized with Pure-Perl module enabled.)

+ Added ICON - Ethernet wire icon for internal clients.

* Changed Auto-Fill feature to either place a question mark near unknown Country / IP
  ranges, or an Ethernet wire for internal IP addresses & or the choice of a country
  flag if one hasn't been detected by TS3's built in GEO DB.

* Changed Traffic Meter for better performance

* Changed the method in which clients use feature groups. Clients now share identical
groups. Groups are only created if called, and destroyed when empty. The only two
feature groups which are still tied independently to a client are the Ping and Status
features. Switching clients between these two features from group to group when ever
a new icon is required, introduces too much global and client-side spam IMO.

- BUG FIXED in Ranking (Next rank calculations were off)

- Minor Bug fixes and code enhancements through out the entire Mod.

! Over 950 Icons in version Ƹ.1

! KNOWN BUG #1 Sometimes negative temperatures display positive icon results under the
  new temperature icon/group feature. This is will be ironed out.

! KNOWN BUG #2 Sometimes the auto-move skips a beat creating / moving a client to the
  new auto channel creation feature (Country->Region->City).

! Some minor RSS and new features need a little work still, and possibly some more
  rbm_settings.cf variables for all the new features as well.


=== Release 2.0 Beta 9 ( December 21 ) ===

+ Added 'Database_Active_Clients_Cache_Time'
  Auto-delete clients from RbMod after a particular amount of time in seconds.

+ Added !purge <clientnickname> and !purgematch <purge_every_nickname_searched>
  for administrators. Cleans out clients both from the TS3 DB and Mod Database.

+ Added Screenshots of each icon category. And an overall screenshot to the
  root of ./rbm_icons/

* Changed ./rbm_icons/* to a categorized sub-folder layout. Upload the icons

=== Release 2.0 Beta 8 ( November 28th ) ===

! NOTE Auto-Move 2 Digit CCode Feature
  This will move anyone that's not designated for Auto-Move already to a 2 digit
  Country Code. If for example, you have 'Canada (CA)' or '(CA) Canada' as a

! NOTE Client Status feature
  Watch for individual status changes of each client connected, If a user
  becomes idle over a set time, RbMod will reflect this with a 'Idle' icon,
  and subsequently when the duration exceeds a second set time for the 'AFK' icon.

* Renamed rbm_settings.cf 'Virtual_Port' variable to 'Query_Virtual_Port'.

* Renamed rbm_settings.cf 'Exempt_Group_IDs' variable to 'Query_Exempt_Group_IDs'.   

* rbm_settings.cf formatted alphabetically for the new web interface.

+ Added 7 new rbm_settings.cf variables:
  WebServer_On
  WebServer_Login
  WebServer_Password
  WebServer_Address
  WebServer_Port
  WebServer_Client_Limit
  WebServer_Client_WhiteList

+ Added stand-alone web server ./rbm_webserver/* (1329k)

  requests from any white listed client you choose. Reboot, Reconnect, Edit
  the settings.cf and MOTD, check RbMods database and purge clients.
  More work yet to come for this new feature.

+ Added RBL (Real-time Blackhole List) feature.
  With this new feature enabled, every new client will be checked (via nslookup)
  against the online RBL at DNS zen.spamhaus.org. White list any IP addresses
  that are known to be friendly.
  RBL_Check_On
  RBL_Check_WhiteList

+ Added Idle-Move Feature.
  Choose which groups to skip over as this feature will move any client found
  idling over a set amount of time to a chosen channel ID. Thx Dan22
  Idle_Move_On

  Idle_Move_Time_Requirement
  Idle_Move_Exempt_Group_IDs

- Fixed bytes sent and received storing to RbMods database for the MOTD.

! KNOWN ISSUES:
  The Web interface may glitch and require a second click from time to time.
  I'll be fine tuning this feature through-out the next few updates.

=== Release 2.0 Beta 6 ( October 7th ) ===

+ Added Auto-Reconnect. RbMod should detect at any time when the TS3 virtual
  server goes offline, and attempt to reconnect ('Query_Retry') X amount of
  times before giving up. 

+ Added Group Protection. Upon joining your server, or being added to any new
  groups, each client will be scanned against a list of protected DBIDs of
  your choosing, and the corresponding group they belong to.

  4 new rbm_settings.cf variables;
  Group_Protected_On
  Group_Protected_GroupID_MemberIDs
  Group_Protected_Kick
  Group_Protected_Punish_Reason


=== Release 2.0 Beta 5 ( October 6th ) ===

- Fixed Nickname Protection from booting 'TeamSpeakUser' clients if guarded
  clients happen to grab it.

* Changed the Channel Language Filter renaming routine, RbMod now replaces each
  swear word with a random word selected from ./rbm_extras/rbm_funwords.cf.

* Changed the Channel Delete Dormant clean-up procedure, any dormant
  sub-channels UNDER an exempt parent channel will be cleaned up now, before
  any channel in the tree that was added to the exemption list also remained
  exempt. RbMod now delete dormant channels DOWN the tree that are under these
  exemptions. This means you can add clan channels for example, and any
  sub-channels they make (perm. or otherwise) will be cleaned up if it remains
  empty beyond the 'Channel_Delete_Dormant_Requirements' variable.


=== Release 2.0 Beta 4 ( October 3rd ) ===

+ Added [RandQuote], [RandWord], [RandQuoteWord] to the MOTD text file.
  Choose whether you would like to display a random quote, random word meaning
  or either of the two randomized when new clients connect and receive the MOTD.

+ Added [Break] to rbm_motd.cf, split up long messages above 1024 characters.
  RbMod will also split long MOTD's without [Break] now but this adds a cleaner,
  more accurate split to your welcome message(s).

+ Added 'Military_Rank_Privileged_Group_IDs' and
  'Military_Rank_Privileged_Client_DBIDs' to rbm_settings.cf, on behalf of
  Dan22's suggestion, you can now list which client ID or group ID's belong
  to a particular starting rank of your choosing. For example; Registered
  clients could start at rank 5 while serveradmins start at rank 15.
  'Military_Rank_Privileged_Group_IDs = 989->15'

* Changed the character limit back to normal. Beta 3 stripped text characters
  over 127 for a few versions.

- Fixed Motd displaying one extra hop per client.

- Fixed 'Query_Limit' slowing down new client connections from being detected
  by the Mod. Shouldn't matter how many clients or how many intervals it takes
  to scan over every client, new joins will be prioritized and scanned over.

- Fixed Channel Language Filter ignoring scan on new channel creations.

- Fixed Channel Language choking on certain ASCII characters.

- Fixed 'Channel_Flood_Detection_Exempt_On' now works correctly.


=== Release 2.0 Beta 3 ( October 1st ) ===

- Removed buffered socket reads.

- Removed 'Traffic_Meter_Interval'

- Fixed Clone departures enhancing user time, when only a single clone should
  of been triggering the update.

- Fixed / Slowed the Group Cleaner, cleans 1 group every 0.5 seconds, as not
  to throttle your TS3 query interface.

- Fixed Nickname Protection doubling / flooding during boot-up, potentially
  causing unnecessary CPU consumption at the beginning.

+ Added Tx / Rx information while debug is on at the command prompt / shell.

+ Added Unbuffered socket READ subroutine. RbMod now reads all open socket
  data until it hits a newline, or 0 bytes in the stream.

+ Added 'Clone_Detection_On' On / Off variable to hide or display RbMods
  Icon pack of 7 clones.

+ Added 'Query_Limit' flag, overrides depreciated flag 'Traffic_Meter_Interval'
  No longer worry about RbMod throttling your TS3 query port.
 
  Every additional query you add to the Query_Limit will split the way RbMod
  reads all your clients.

  For example, if you have 18 clients connected, and you set
  Query_Limit = 10, RbMod will read 10 clients one second, and 8 the next.

  Type 'Debug On' at the console and watch the Tx / Rx from RbMod <-> TS3 to
  better understand how much input RbMod receives from TS3 with X amount of
  queries set.


=== Release 2.0 Beta 2 ( September 24 ) ===

+ Added Help / Exit / Say <msg> / Shutdown / Reload / Debug <On/Off> and more
  commands to the Terminal / Console for RbMod Sysops.

+ Added UTF8 Support throughout the Mod.

+ Added ANSI Color support to the Terminal / Console.

+ Added MOTD Two customizable areas included, first area will greet new joins
  to the server with a message of your choosing, the latter greets subsequent
  log-ins, with RbMod variables to play with for both. All TS3 text formatting
  also works.
 
  Some RbMod MOTD Commands you can use...
  Nick, Version, IP, LastLoginTime, LastLoginElapsed, LastChan, Hops, Rank,
  DNS, FirstLoginTime, FirstLoginElapsed, MBSent, MBRecv and more to come.

  Short Message Of The Day example:

  Welcome to the server [B][Nick][/B]!
  I notice this is your first time here,
  please feel free to browse around.
  Your Teamspeak3 version is [Version].
  Detected OS: [OS].
  Your IP: [IP].
 
  Make updates to the .cf and RbMod will automatically detect the change and
  reload the file. This is a fairly new feature which still needs some work
  over the next few releases.

+ Added flag 'Query_Retry', select how many connection attempts to make
  before giving up.

+ Added flag 'Query_Retry_Delay', pick the length in which to wait between
  retries.

+ Added flag 'Console_Text_Color', choose the default console color in which
  to run RbMod in. Choices are; Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan or
  White

- Removed temporary settings flag 'Cleanup_TS3_And_Shutdown' since this is
  performed at every boot-up / soft shutdown.

- Fixed Socket reconnect on failed attempts.

- Fixed up Terminal / Console formatting.

- Fixed Mod hanging after renaming a channel for bad word matches.

- Fixed Time remaining until next rank. Time was a tad off.

- Fixed Cleaning of 'Rb Sticky', 'Rb iOS', 'Rb Windows'. ALL groups should
  cleanup every boot-up or upon typing 'exit' now.

- Fixed Language filter skipping a beat from time to time on channel names.

- Other minor bug fixes.


=== Release 2.0 Beta 1 ( September 20 ) ===

! 100% Rewritten Mod engine / features.

! Windows and Linux compatible now.

* Reduced CPU / Memory consumption significantly.

* Added more icon options. Total of 575 icons in RbMod v2.0!

* 1 Thread (Process) vs two, plus tens if not hundreds in RbMod v1.

* 1 Query Socket vs two, plus tens if not hundreds in RbMod v1.

* Independent Flat File Database, vs 3rd party SQ-Lite install in RbMod v1.

* The Default Guest group for RbMod replicates your servers guest group now.
  This takes place every boot-up. No need to edit a .cf file any longer.

! Some 'light' features such as quotes and random word meanings are still
  missing in this version. I'll be sure to program these ASAP.

! 4 new features added. Ranking (Icon) System. Auto-Move Clients & Groups.
  Auto-Delete dormant channels. Reverse DNS detection for clients. And more
  yet to come.

+ TRAFFIC METER - One of RbMods largest attractions has now been rewritten
  to produce the smoothest possible output for your TS3 server. In the
  previous RbMod releases, all the dynamic icon updates took place in a
  group generated per client. Since discovering that this method has it's
  limitations (most apparent; CPU cycles generated for each icon update),
  RbMod now uses the 'Client' icon slot instead, which pans out to be much
  less overhead on the TS3 server processing the image updates. There's
  also an interval toggle to slow down this particular feature if need be.

+ RANKING - Inspired by the gaming community and a few individuals, RbMod
  now includes 2 icon packs to choose from. Pack 1 consists of 62 ranked
  icons, while pack 2 holds 27 more true to life insignias with names for
  each. Set the the rank time requirements to start with, and watch client
  ranks update live online on. Subsequent ranks become harder to reach as
  each clients TOTAL time + scale + time / 3 = Next rank.

+ TRACE ROUTE - Rewritten to produce a finer output than it's previous
  predecessor in RbMod v1.0. This version now includes the default option
  of performing a back to back trace per client. Using either ICMP / SYN
  in Linux or just finding the highest path possible. Also includes a 4th
  Icon pack of 41 new hop numbers (Default orange theme).

+ REVERSE DNS - Strictly for informative purposes, you can issue private
  messages to new joins depicting the reverse DNS from their ISP.

+ CLONE DETECTION - Unlike version 1, this new clone detection uses a
  completely new icon pack of 7 human figure icons. each lighting up
  depending on the amount of clones per individual DBID. Future plans
  to detect cloned IP's are in the works like version one held.

+ O/S DETECTION - Automatically detecting Windows / Linux / Mac or iOS
  clients and visually displaying the appropriate icon. Four slightly
  reworked OS icons have been added to the mix in RbMod v2.0.

+ AUTO-MOVE CLIENTS/GROUPS - On behalf of a few personal requests, RbMod
  now detects upon joining the server either a clients group, or client
  DBID which in turn will placed in a specified channel ID.

+ AUTO-DELETE DORMANT CHANNELS - Also upon a few large server admin
  inquiries, RbMod will cleanup any temp,semi,perm. channel outside it's
  exemption list, after laying dormant for a specified amount of time.
  Be sure to add ALL your channel IDs (children excluded, as they remain
  safe), before turning this feature ON.

+ CHANNEL FLOOD DETECTION - Rewritten to give the server admin the option
  of either punishing, kicking or banning an individual for spamming
  through all the channels. Punishment includes the old temporary channel
  creation upon infractions, or the ability to use your own channel and
  move the person back to a default channel once unpunished.

+ CHANNEL LANGUAGE FILTER - Designed for performance, this new version
  includes an interval option but probably isn't necessary. as each room
  will be scanned against the list of 'bad words' only when the name
  changes, or the channel's created for the first time.

+ NICKNAME LANGUAGE FILTER - Like the Channel Language Filter, every
  client gets reviewed for changes, only once a name change is detected
  will RbMod scan for bad words against the current update.

+ NICKNAME PROTECTION - With 7 settings to choose from, you can now
  protect a group of clients from other groups stealing your protected
  client names. Choose whether to punish the same group members for using
  a safe name, or just choose a kick / ban reason.

+ DYNAMIC BANNERS - Many admins seem to enjoy this feature, RbMod v2.0 now
  gives you the ability to choose a list of as many Image URLs as you like.
  With the capability of changing the banner LINKS on it's own independent
  time cycle. Change the banner link once every 2 banners or choose which
  ever variations suite your setup.

+ WELCOME BACK - Something fairly new, announce the time lapsed
  for each client last seen upon joining. This feature will actually grow
  into something a little more over the next few releases.


=== Release 1.0 Beta 4 (Aug 25) ===

+ ADDED 'default_ban_duration' flag under rbm_settings.cfg. This applies to
  !nickguard protection - More Ban options coming next.

+ ADDED 'realtime_animated_traffic_meter' flag to reduce or speedup the prime
  portion of code that can slow some CPU's / bandwidth down with too many
  clientinfo requests. Busy servers might also appreciate this flag.

+ ADDED Logging option under settings. All RbMod Information is written to a
  new log (/logs/) at boot-up.

+ ADDED 'multiple_banners_links' to coincide with your dynamic URL links.
  You can choose 3 links for 3 URLS, or 2 even 1 link for all your URLs...
  Each banner link should be separated in relation with the banner URLs to
  achieve the right sort order.

* CHANGED The entire code base to Perl 5.10 (2007+). Requires Perl 5.10.0+ which
  we should all have already ;)

* CHANGED Guest permissions (rbm_guests.cf) to upload at each boot-up.

* CHANGED 'safe_groups' flag to apply to Channel & Server flood as well as
  Nick protection.

- REMOVED ft_port flag in settings. This belonged to the icon upload engine
  I originally wrote but removed due to port 30033 transfer limitations..

- FIXED Max flood time not sticking to default 500 or users input upon boot-up.

- FIXED trace router results for clients under Linux. Should be in order now.

- FIXED 'multiple_banners_urls' got lost in the shuffle before Beta 3 release.
  I rewrote most of this to start from left to write and repeat with the new
  feature 'multiple_banners_links'.

! NOTE bad word & channel flooding still needs 'safe_groups' code, coming.


=== Release 1.0 Beta 3 (Aug 22) ===

 + Added Nickname And Channel Language Filters
   Drawing upon 450 default 'bad words', separated into an individual .cf file
   for additional swear word combinations. Each channel and nickname are now
   monitored against any word of your choosing.

 + Added iOS icon/group for iOS clients.

 + Added new feature: Channel Flood Guard
   Depending on the settings you choose, each client (without ignore_sticky),
   whom changes channels too quickly, will be moved and stuck for a set time.
   If 'flip_max' exceeds limit, & below 'flip_maxtime'. Unstuck accordingly when
   'flip_punish' times out.


=== Release 1.0 Beta 2 - July 31 2012 ===

 + Multiple threads W/ Multiple Sockets
   RbMod uses 2 threads when first launched. And another thread per client
   connection. Each thread also connects to the TS3 server with an individual
   socket.

 + Independent Sq-lite DB
   Just like TeamSpeak3, RbMod uses a totally separate DB to cache user results,
   such as traces and Wiki look-ups, also acting as an inter mediator between the
   forked processes/threads running.

 + Animated traffic meter
   Based on each clients bytes Tx/Rx, and active channel, you can now watch each
   users throughput on the server!
   17x17 combinations, 289 custom icons.

 + Hop/Route detection
   Performs a hi-speed trace between the bot and client, producing an icon plus
   description update. RbMod also caches each users results for quicker updates.
   3 packs of 41 different numbers, 123 custom icons.

 + O/S Detection
   Visually sets a Windows or Mac and other icons for each client O/S type.

 + Clone Detection
   Produces either a x2 or x3, x4 etc. icon, based on the number of clones
   connected from a single DB ID or IP address.
   1 - 9+, 9 custom icons.

 + Nickname Protection
   Using !nickguard will protect an individuals current nickname on, or offline
   from any other user trying to steal it. If someone joins or changes their
   name to anything related to yours, they will first receive a warning then &
   a kick/ban depending on the settings.cf flag.

 + Dynamic Banner
   TS3 can unfortunately be a little 'verbose' at times, so take caution when
   using this first method. RbMods dynamic banner system hard sets the image
   path(s) given in the setting.cf. If the timer flag is set to say, 60 seconds,
   TS3 will verbally announce a server edit. So perhaps every 3600 or so for those
   that just want to switch banners from time to time, this would be a reasonable
   time limit IMHO.

 + 241 Random Quotes
   Either globally or personally messaging RbMod with !Quote will produce a
   randomly generated quote.

 + 150+ Acronyms/Words
   RbMod will pickup on individual words from time to time and display
   the results plus another word suggestion back to the client.

 + Help Menu
   !help will list any toggles or features already mentioned in this change log.


=== Release 1.0 Beta 1 - July 12 2012 ===

 * Internal beta staged on local VOIP server(s).
